## References
Listed here are some useful references for studying neural network-based machine learning. I primarily use PyTorch (Facebook) for my neural networks but TensorFlow developed by Google is also very powerful.

### Machine Learning: Andrew Ng

[This](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) is a good introduction course to neural networks by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

### Introduction to Pytorch

[This page](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/pytorch/) includes a link to PyTorch and to tutorials to get you started with PyTorch.
